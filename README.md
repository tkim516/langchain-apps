This app showcases a collection of small, practice applications built with LangChain, OpenAI, Serper API, Pinecone, and Streamlit. 
- **LangChain**: Provides the logic for connecting and orchestrating applications.  
- **OpenAI**: Utilizes `gpt-4o-mini` for the LLM and `text-embedding-3-large` for embeddings.  
- **Pinecone**: Handles vector embedding storage and search.  
- **Serper API**: Enables internet search functionality.  
- **Streamlit**: Serves as the framework for building the web app.
